* After pulling from this repo, open a terminal and switch to the directory you've pulled the code into.
* Then run 'pod install' to pull down the appropriate Cocoapods.
* After successful installation of Cocoapods, please open the .xcworkspace file from the directory in XCode.
* Build and enjoy!

### What is this repository for? ###

* To demonstrate my ability of coding a small project that satisfies the following requirements:
At a high‐level your application must meet the following requirements:
      * Search Function: It should have the ability to search for a player given a combination of player lastname and firstname. It should then display this list to the user along with some pertinent information about the player to aid in the user finding the specific player the user was looking for. Upon selecting a player from the list, it should display more detailed biographical information about the player, and perhaps his batting/pitching stats (you can pick which ones).
      * Team Roster: It should include a list of teams, and allow users to select a specific team in order to view that team’s complete roster. Selecting any player on the roster should display more detailed biographical information about the player (similar to above).
      * In addition to these user requirements the application should meet the following technical requirements:
         * It should be build using the iOS SDK and UIKit Framework
         * It should be designed to run on the iPhone or iPad (Bonus points for a universal app)
         * It should utilize the backend REST api provided below.
         * The use of third‐party libraries for low‐level functionality (e.g. AFNetworking for HTTP) is allowed.
